# SocketTCP

Server/client comunicating through TCP/IP protocol, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. ...
In base terms, TCP/IP allows one computer to talk to another computer via the Internet through compiling packets of data and sending them to right location.


What we need to do is:

1. Create a socket
2. Bind the socket to an address
3. Listen for connections
4. Accept a connection
5. Send and receive data.

You can find the code in C both for server and client side.
